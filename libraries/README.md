# Libaries

Since Luau has stripped many function fro the standard Lua libraries, and because i plan to switch the [mani](https://github.com/DragosPopse/mani) generator to use Luau, i decided to include a small set of completely optional libraries to restore some of that functionality in an effort to also gain some experince working with the Luau API.

These are by no means performant libraries, i just expose Odin libraries to Luau. If you think you can improve them, please do so and open a PR!
